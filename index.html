      <p>Joe Palmer is an artist and programmer. They have a passion for creating things that are both beautiful and functional. They have a vast portfolio that ranges from video games to mobile apps, and even a few failed experiments in turning a tin of baked beans into a cyborg.
When they're not coding or painting, you can find them trying to make music with their pocket synth or attempting to build a fully functional TARDIS. They have a motto that goes 'Nothing is impossible unless proven to be so' (with a few exceptions, like world peace and good hair days)</p>
